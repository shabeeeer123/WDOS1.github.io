            <h2>Sri Lankan Turtle population</h2>
            <p >
                Sri Lanka is home to a diverse and significant turtle population. The country's coastal areas give vital
                nesting grounds and feeding habitats for several turtle species,
                including the critically endangered Hawksbill turtle, the risked Green turtle,
                the Olive ridley turtle, and the Loggerhead turtle.
                The Hawksbill turtle is a particularly significant species in Sri Lanka. Known for its strikingly beautiful shell,
                it faces many hazards, including illegal trade, habitat declination, and climate change impacts.
                Efforts are being made to cover and conserve Hawksbill turtles,
                with a focus on securing their nesting spots and raising awareness about their ecological importance.
                Green turtles are another prominent species set up in Sri Lankan waters.
                They're known for their carnivorous diet and play a critical part in maintaining the health of seagrass beds.

            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p >
                Welcome to our Turtle Hatchery,
                            dedicated to the conservation and protection of Sri Lanka's turtle population.
                            We collect and incubate turtle eggs, providing a safe environment for their hatching.
                            Our team nurtures the hatchlings until they are ready for their journey to the sea.
                            We also raise awareness in local communities about turtle conservation.
                                Your support directly contributes to preserving these incredible creatures and their habitats.
                                Join us in our mission to ensure a brighter future for turtles.

            <h2>Hatchery Regions</h2>
            <p >
                Turtles hatch in several regions along Sri Lanka's coast,
             including Rekawa, Kosgoda, Pottuvil, Panama, Tangalle, and Hikkaduwa.
              These areas are known for their nesting sites and conservation efforts.
               Green, Loggerhead, Olive ridley, Hawksbill, and Leatherback turtles are among
                the species that lay their eggs in these regions. They play a significant role
                 in the preservation of Sri Lanka's turtle population and offer opportunities
                  for visitors to learn about turtle conservation and witness hatchlings being released into the ocean.
