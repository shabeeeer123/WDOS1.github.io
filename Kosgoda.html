      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery, also known as the Kosgoda Sea Turtle Conservation Project,
         is a popular conservation initiative located in Kosgoda, a coastal town in Sri Lanka.
          Established in 1981, the hatchery aims to protect sea turtles and their eggs from various
           threats while promoting awareness and education about these endangered creatures.

      <h2>Our mission</h2>
      <p> The primary objective of the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery is to conserve and increase the declining sea turtle population
         along the Sri Lankan coast. Several species of sea turtles, including the Olive Ridley, Green, Hawksbill,
          and Loggerhead turtles, are found in the waters around Sri Lanka. Unfortunately,
           these magnificent creatures face numerous challenges such as habitat destruction, poaching, pollution, 
           and accidental capture in fishing nets.
        The hatchery operates as a rescue center for injured and disabled sea turtles, as well as a nesting site for turtles
         to lay their eggs safely. Local villagers and volunteers patrol the nearby beaches to locate sea turtle nests and collect
          the eggs to protect them from predators and poachers. The eggs are then carefully transferred to the hatchery's artificial
           nests, where they are monitored until hatching.

      <h2>Activities</h2>
      <p> Visitors to the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery can learn about the different turtle species, their life cycles,
         and the threats they face through informative exhibits and guided tours. The hatchery staff also conducts educational
          programs to raise awareness among local communities, schools, and tourists about the importance of turtle conservation.
        In addition to conservation efforts, the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery actively engages in research and collaborates with
         national and international organizations to gather data on sea turtle populations and their behavior.
          These research efforts contribute to a better understanding of these endangered species and help develop effective
           conservation strategies.   
        By visiting the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery, tourists and locals alike can witness the conservation efforts firsthand,
         support the hatchery's initiatives through donations, and experience the joy of releasing baby turtles into the ocean,
          thus contributing to the preservation of these magnificent creatures for future generations.
