            The Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery is dedicated to the protection and conservation of sea turtles in Sri Lanka.
             It serves as a sanctuary for injured, sick, and orphaned turtles, as well as a nesting site for endangered
             sea turtle species.
            The hatchery plays a crucial role in raising awareness about sea turtle conservation among locals, tourists,
             and the fishing community. It educates visitors about the threats faced by sea turtles, such as habitat destruction,
              pollution, and poaching, and the importance of their preservation.      
            One of the primary focuses of the hatchery is to collect sea turtle eggs from vulnerable nests along the coastline.
             These eggs are carefully incubated in a controlled environment to increase their chances of survival.
              Once the hatchlings emerge, they are nurtured until they are strong enough to be released back into the ocean.            
            The Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery also provides medical care and rehabilitation for injured turtles.
             They treat turtles that have been injured by fishing nets, boats, or other human activities.
              The hatchery's staff and volunteers work tirelessly to heal these turtles and release them back into the wild
               whenever possible.            
            Visitors to the Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery have the opportunity to observe these incredible creatures up close.
             They can learn about the different turtle species found in Sri Lanka, their life cycles, and the efforts being
              made to protect them. Additionally, the hatchery offers the unique experience of releasing baby turtles into the ocean,
               providing visitors with a memorable and meaningful experience.           
            The Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery serves as a beacon of hope for sea turtle conservation in Sri Lanka. Through its efforts,
             it not only contributes to the preservation of these magnificent creatures but also raises awareness about the
              importance of protecting our marine ecosystems.
