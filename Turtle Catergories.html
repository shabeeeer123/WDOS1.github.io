        In Sri Lanka, there are several categories of turtles that inhabit the coastal regions 
        and play a vital role in the country's rich biodiversity.<br> Here are some of the prominent
         turtle categories found in Sri Lanka.

          <h2>Hawksbill Turtle</h2>
          <p >
            Hawksbill turtles are a critically endangered species of sea turtle found
             in various oceanic regions. They are known for their stunningly beautiful tortoiseshell
             patterned carapace, which is highly valuable but unfortunately has led to their population decline due to illegal trade.
            Hawksbill turtles primarily inhabit coral reefs, where they play a crucial role in maintaining the health 
            and balance of these ecosystems. They have a specialized diet, feeding on sponges, algae, and other invertebrates
             found within coral reef habitats. This diet makes them important for controlling the growth of certain species
              and maintaining the overall biodiversity of the reef.         
            In Sri Lanka, Hawksbill turtles can be found nesting on selected beaches,
             particularly those with rocky or coral-rich surroundings. However, 
             their nesting numbers are relatively smaller compared to other sea turtle species.
              Female Hawksbills return to their natal beaches to lay their eggs,
               digging nests in the sand where they bury their clutch of eggs before returning to the ocean.

              <h2>Loggerhead Turtle</h2>
              <p >
                Loggerhead turtles are recognized by their large heads and strong jaws,
                 which enable them to consume hard-shelled prey such as crabs and mollusks.
                  They have a robust and muscular build, making them well-suited for diving and navigating the ocean currents.
                  Although loggerhead turtles are not as abundant as some other turtle species in Sri Lanka,
                  they can still be occasionally sighted along the country's coastal waters. They are known to nest on selected sandy beaches, 
                   particularly along the southern coast. Female loggerheads dig nests in the sand and lay their eggs before returning to the sea.
                    These turtles undertake long-distance migrations, moving between foraging grounds and nesting sites.
                     They are known to traverse thousands of miles across oceans, making them highly resilient and adaptable to different environments.

              <h2>Leatherback Turtle</h2>
              <p >
                Leatherback turtles are the largest species of sea turtles and hold the title for the deepest-diving turtle.
                they have a unique physical appearance that distinguishes them from other turtle species.
                 Instead of a hard shell, they possess a leathery skin with ridges, which gives them their name.
                  Their carapace is flexible and covered in a layer of thick, rubbery skin, making them more streamlined
                   and adapted for long-distance swimming.               
                These turtles are highly migratory and can travel vast distances in search of food and suitable nesting sites.
                 They have a global distribution, including Sri Lanka, although sightings in Sri Lankan waters are relatively rare.                
                Leatherback turtles have a specialized diet, primarily feeding on jellyfish. They have adaptations such as a sharp,
                 pointed beak and backward-facing spines in their throats to aid in capturing and consuming their gelatinous prey.                
                When it comes to nesting, leatherback turtles typically choose remote beaches for their egg-laying activities.
                 They dig deep nests in the sand to protect their eggs, and the female turtles exhibit a unique behavior of covering
                  their nests with sand using their flippers.               
                Conservation efforts for leatherback turtles focus on reducing threats such as accidental capture in fishing gear,
                 habitat degradation, and pollution. Protecting their nesting habitats and raising awareness about the importance
                  of preserving these magnificent creatures is crucial for their survival.                
                Given their size and distinctive characteristics, leatherback turtles hold a special place in Sri Lanka's
                 coastal biodiversity, symbolizing the wonder and diversity of marine life.
